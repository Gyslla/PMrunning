Python scripts were developed to support the pre-processing and initial analysis of event logs extracted from open government data. These codes automatically calculate the nominal and percentage frequency of activities within the event records, assisting in the identification of process behavior patterns. In addition to frequency calculations, the scripts generate comparative graphical visualizations, representing the most frequent activities and their percentage participation in the analyzed processes. The solutions were designed to be lightweight, accessible, and easy to use, contributing to exploratory analysis and data preparation for process mining applications.
